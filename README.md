# Introduction.

This repository is a collection of my C language tutorials and practice problems. It contains code examples, explanations, and solutions that I have compiled to help reinforce my understanding of C programming. The repository is intended as a personal learning resource, but it may also be helpful to others who are learning C or preparing for technical interviews.

## Folder Structure:
The repository is organized as follows:

### Tutorial:
Contains code examples that explain various C programming concepts. Each file is well-commented to explain the logic and purpose behind the code.

### Practice problems:
This folder includes a range of practice problems, from basic to advanced, with solutions. The problems cover various topics such as loops, arrays, pointers, strings, and algorithms.

### README.md:
This file provides an overview of the repository and how to use it.

## Getting Started:
To get started with this repository:

### Clone the repository:
Copy code: git clone https://github.com/abhay-Devo/C-Language-Tutorials-and-Pracitce-Problems.git

### Navigate to the repository:
Copy code: '''cd your-repo-name'''

#### Ensure you have a C compiler installed :- You can use GCC, which is available on most platforms.

### To compile and run a C program:
Copy code: '''gcc filename.c -o outputname'''

#### Output code: '''./outputname'''

## How to Use the Code:

### Tutorial Code:
Each tutorial file focuses on a specific concept of C programming. You can read the code and comments to understand how the concept is applied.

### Practice Problems:
The practice problems are designed to test and reinforce your understanding. Try solving the problems on your own before looking at the provided solutions.

## Content Overview.

### Tutorials:
The tutorials cover the following topics--

-> Basic Syntax :- Variables, data types, operators

-> Control Structures :- if, else, switch, loops (for, while, do-while)

-> Functions :- Declaration, definition, passing parameters

-> Arrays :- Single-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays

-> Pointers :- Pointer basics, pointer arithmetic, pointers with arrays

-> Strings :- String handling functions, character arrays

-> Structures :- Defining and using structures, nested structures

-> File I/O :- Reading from and writing to files

### Practice Problems:
The practice problems include-

-> Basic Programs :- Simple programs to get familiar with syntax and logic.

-> Loops :- Problems focusing on loop structures.

-> Arrays :- Sorting, searching, and manipulating arrays.

-> Strings :- String manipulation and pattern matching.

-> Algorithms :- Implementations of common algorithms such as sorting and searching.

### Future Goals:
Add more advanced practice problems. Include solutions and explanations for competitive programming challenges.
